((((Live Room Temperature Project))))

  Design a website that streams live ambient temperature data from an arduino microcontroller.

Front End (Client side)
  HTML 
  CSS (sass)
  JavaScript (chart.js)

These are used to build the website and configure its design


Backend
  C++ (Collects voltage data from temperature probs and converts it to a temperature reading)
  Python (Collects streaming temperature data and puts it into a .csv file)

These are used to collect and transform the data gathered to something that can be presented client side


((((Git & GITHUB))))

GIT(Global Information Tracker) - Version Control, keep track of different versions of your project. Local to your system.
- Gives you a full revision history of your projects.
- Syncronises code beteween various people I.E., you can both make changes to the same document and then merge them together in a     central server I.E., gives everyone the latest version of code.
- Good at testing changes to code without losing original I.E., branching.
- Can revert back to previous versions 



GitHub - cloud based hosting service for Git respositories (folder where you contain code you want to keep track of I.E., the versions)
 - Other people can then interact with these versions over the cloud.
